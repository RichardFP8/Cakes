# I attempted to make an e-commerce website for pastries. 

# The prject was to make 5 pages and add basic html elements with bootstrap components too; we were given one week
# I added lots of images, some from Google Images, others from the public domain page and others from an example project(since the corresponding component was working fine with that image size)
# I added lots of components, here and there, most for fun. I added some cool colors to make some of the text stand out because why not? I'm pretty sure I'm the person who's not good with the styling of the page I was just typing keys and seeing what I though looked fine.
# Each day I made changes and by the ned of the day I added those to the staging area and then commited those changes to the current branch. I actually decided to use a branch aside from the main(DEVELOPER) to have all the latest changes. In the final minutes before presenting I merged that side branch to the main and pushed it to the remote. Why am I getting so specific?
# I have 1 main issue and that's in the products page where when I close the accordion components, the footer rises but the width remains the same, so there's empty space from the bottom of the footer. If that makes sense
# The most interesting part of this project was when I used media queries to show a HTML table in the checkout page; I think there are easier/smarter ways to make it appear and dissapear. But I found it interesting how fast I was able to come up with an idea and use it and have it worked out fine from the start.
